As and when I will develop a project/mini project in python, I upload it here for the following reason(s):

    i. As a reference to people who are working on similar project(s)
    ii. For others to take new ideas about their upcoming/undergoing project(s)
    iii. for my personal records & to keep my work safe & easily accessible.

Besides this, I might also upload some python programs which aren't any project, but those programs were written by me in python to either:

    i. understand a concept in python and/or
    ii. to practice a concept in python.

My files may not be that useful to experienced people/laterals in the field of software development, but I anticipate beginners will definitely get help/new ideas from my files as how to go about in their projects.

I will soon make a repositories containing my previous projects in C & Java, as and when I get time.

An advise to programmers, especially if you are beginner in the field of programming or a STEM student or related to softwaring - The advice is that when ever you go through a code/program especially a program that is someone's project/mini project, other than just taking a mere reference for your homework/assignments, you should think and analyze these few things:
    i. How can this program/mini project can be made better in terms of user's ease of handling, memory       consumption, representing O/P in a way wherein the user can understand it better, etc
    ii. What more features can be added into this project/mini project.

Hope it helps you.
